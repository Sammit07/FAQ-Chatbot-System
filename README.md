# FAQ Chatbot System

## Project Overview

The FAQ Chatbot System is an AI-powered chatbot application designed to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) for website. Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, this chatbot provides accurate and instant responses to user queries. This system helps improve user experience by offering 24/7 support to users, reducing the workload on the support team.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Responses**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to provide intelligent, conversational responses.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Implements NLP techniques to understand user questions and deliver relevant answers.
- **Dynamic Content Updating**: Uses web scraping to keep the FAQ database up-to-date with relevant information.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A responsive interface that provides an accessible and intuitive user experience.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Users can provide feedback on responses, helping to improve chatbot accuracy over time.
- **24/7 Availability**: Offers constant availability, providing users with answers at any time.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend Framework**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend Framework**: React or Angular (for a dynamic user interface)
- **NLP Model**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Web Scraping**: Beautiful Soup for gathering and updating FAQ content
- **Database**: Stores FAQ data and user interactions for efficient query handling
- **Environment Configuration**: `.env` file for securely storing sensitive information such as API keys

## Project Structure

- **app.py** - Main file that initializes and runs the Flask application.
- **main.py** - Core logic for handling chatbot requests and responses.
- **utils.py** - Utility functions used throughout the project, including data processing and response handling.
- **static/** - Contains static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- **templates/** - HTML templates for rendering the web interface.
- **.env** - Stores environment variables such as API keys for security.
- **requirements.txt** - Lists all Python dependencies for the project.
- **package.json & package-lock.json** - Define frontend dependencies if a JavaScript framework is used.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, ensure you have:
- **Python** 3.8 or higher installed
- **Node.js** and **npm** (if using a frontend framework like React or Angular)
